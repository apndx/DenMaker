# Week 8

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 8

I continued performance testing, and also made some graphs from the results and started analysing the results. I also started analysing the time requirement from the code. I made a conclusion that the mazebuilding was slowed down by the OwnArrayList, and Entrance opener by the algorithm that very unefficiently changed the region. In the end I decided that as the unifying function was still uncompleted, I will leave it out from the final program as scheduling does not allow me to make any radical changes in this stage. After leaving this method out, the performance of entrance opening was improved significantly. I made the entrance opening strongly to prefere connecting to the maze instead of other rooms, and this improved the connectivity quite well.

As the dead line was coming nearer, I decided to wrap up the project. I did some clean up of the code, finished the JavaDoc, implementation document and the jar of the project.

### What did I learn?
 
I learned that I should have considered the efficiency of my methods in more detail sooner so I could have made some drastic changes to the data structures. 

### Thoughts when finishing the project

This has been a really fun project, and I think I have also learned a thing or two. In the future I hope I will have the patience to plan everything in a more detailed manner, and also concentrate a lot more on testing in the early stages.
