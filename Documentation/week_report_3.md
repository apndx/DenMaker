# Week 3

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 3

This week I continued researching the topic of maze generation, and especially Prim's algorithm. In the end of the week my dungeon now has a maze generation. However, the output is not quite how I want it to be yet. The maze fills the entire area, but it should avoid the rooms and yet it does not. Also the edges of the area are not same width at the moment.


### What did I learn?
 
I learned once again that it is sometimes hard to make things work how I have imagined them in the first place. I also have a hunch that I often write things in a more complicated way than they need to be, and would like to improve this.


### Problems

This week I was able to start working on the project a bit later than I would have wanted (on Wednesday), so I was in quite a hurry to get done the things I had scheduled for the week. It took me quite some time to understand how the maze building algorithm works, and even more time to implement it. So, the lack of time and poor scheduling were the biggest problems this week. I wish I could have made final adjustments to the maze builder and more test, but I will start next week by working on these.


### Questions

Should we test the user interface? I'm not testing that at the moment.
I'm using a lot of trying and catching not to go over the edges or to null pointer in the maze generator, I'm not sure if that's a good idea.


### Next week

I will fix my mazemaker to recognize the rooms. Then I will start writing the implementation and testing documentation. Also I will implement algorithms for opening doors from rooms to corridors and pruning some dead ends from the maze. Tests need to be improved. I will also start testing efficiency and implementing my own data structures. Quite a week ahead of me then!
