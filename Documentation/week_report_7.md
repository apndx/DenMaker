# Week 7

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 7

This I had the demo, basicly just demonstrated the den creating process from main menu.

I continued documentation by creating [UML-diagram](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/IML_attributes.png) from Netbeans by using easyUML.

I refactored my benchmark class to shorted methods so I can test it. I filled in some missing JavaDocs.
After that I made some unit test for the benchmark class to make sure it measures what it should, and also to area class and new parts of logic class.

I also patched the mazebuilder test that were not too comprehensive before.

After that I continued performance testing. Very soon I realised, that the parametres that I had previously used were not easily comparable.

I decided to create another testround that has linearly rising amount of area tiles, and same density of rooms in all scales.


### What did I learn?
 
Testing should be planned better before implementation.

### Problems

How to get performance test results that are easy to compare?


### Next week

Finishing everything. Performance testing completed, and documentation as well. Hopefully I will also have time to root out all mysterious bugs.
