# Week 7

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 7

This I had the demo, basicly just demonstrated the den creating process from main menu.

I continued documentation by creating [UML-diagram](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/IML_attributes.png)from Netbeans by using easyUML.

I refactored my benchmark class to shorted methods so I can test it. I filled in some missing JavaDocs.
After that I made some unit test for the benchmark class to make sure it measures what it should, and also to area class and new parts of logic class.

### What did I learn?
