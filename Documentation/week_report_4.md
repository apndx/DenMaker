# Week 4

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 4

This week I seem to be struggling with one-off problems. I fixed the asymmetrical area by forcing the area parameters to be always odd numbers. Also now the roomwalls are regocnised, as I made them differ from the corridor and room content. At the same time stored the wall tiles to use them for opening entrances for the rooms. I also made a maze trimming algorithm that does some trimming, but I should probably improve it to do it in a more controlled manner.


### What did I learn?
 
It is still quite hard to get my head around the diffecences of coordinates, array indexes and length of things.
