# Week 1

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/Documentation/hours.md)

## What has happened during week 1

First I chose the subject. I was drawn to this idea of random generated caves, the idea of randomness seems appealing. I also would like to learn more about algorithms that find paths and also visualisation aspects. I don't know how relevant these subjects will be for my studies in general, but I think I need an subject that I find inspiring and this seem promising.

### What did I learn?

I started reading about suggested solutions for dungeon creation, it does not seem very easy, but I hope I will manage. The systematic and well explained approach in Bob Nystroms blog seems like a good starting point.
I learned what I should accomplish and started looking for good algorithms to use to solve these problems. 

### Problems

I have little experience in algorithmic problem solving, mostly from the datastructures and algorithms course from last sprign. As I have not done any project like this previously, I'm not yet sure how this is going to work, but I am hoping to learn a lot along the way.

### Questions

I wonder if the algorithm and datastructure ideas are good choices for this project, all comments on these are greatly appreciated.

### Next week

I will start creating the core of this project, starting the structure for the project and thinking about the random generator. In the beginning I will use the datastructures available in Java, and later replace them with my own implementation. I wish to achieve something visible output at the end of the week, perhaps the first text file creation. I will start to work on Javadoc and JUnit testing along the way.
