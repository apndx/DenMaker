# Week 5

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 5

This week I started working on a solution on how to make sure there are no isolated areas. It is not yet perfect, but I priorised other things that I had to get done this week.

I started testing preformance, I wanted to get some results before I start using my own arraylist.
I made to the logic a method that saves times of creating the random rooms, making maze, adding entrances and trimming dead ends. These times are now printed together with the maze prints.

Also there is now a seperate testing option in the main menu. It takes dungeon measurements, the amount of rooms and amount of test rounds as parametres, and prints average results of the test rounds.

### What did I learn?

While doing performance tests and checking out the results, I noticed that there might be now something fishy about the entrance making algorithm, as it starts to perform very poorly when the area size gets bigger. 

### Problems

Making sure there are now isolated rooms will take some extra work, I hope I will have time to perfect that at some point.

### Next week

I will see what is slowing down the entrace making. I will continue implementation and testing documents and also user manual. I will finish my own array list and make a random generator, and also start using these. I will continue testing, and also test performance with the new datastructures.
