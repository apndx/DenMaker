# Week 6

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 6

I started by reading the first peer review of my project, and wondering how I can assure that my ASCII will look the same for all users. Then I continued array list and fixed room tests that had, again, one off problem.

I tried first creating my own arraylist that had a very simple removal method. It performed poorly, so I did some adjustments, which helped a bit.

After that tried optimising my den by starting with a integer content and changing the content into string only when printing.

The I pondered a bit about doing my own random generator, but luckily that was not necessary in the end.

After reading the second peer review, I did some adjustments to tests. I made a new benchmark class for the performance test methods, and also a new feature that runs a default test run that is easier to compare. I hope this effort will pay off in the next two weeks.

### What did I learn?
 
"Little" adjustments can take a lot of time. However, I think I will benefit from my new testing approach next week.

### Problems

I still have not have time to addressed the anomalities in my maze creation code.

### Next week

A lot more unit testing is needed. I also need to start an user's manual, and finish implementation document. I will also continue adding to the testing document, and make some more summaries and analysis of the results. If I happen to have some extra time, I will dive into the maze algorithm and try to make it perfect. Javadoc needs to be completed as well.
