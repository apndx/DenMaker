# Week 6

[Hour list](https://github.com/apndx/DenMaker/blob/master/Documentation/hours.md)


## What has happened during week 6

I started by reading a peer review of my project, and wonderin how I can assure that my ASCII will look the same for all users. Then I continued array list and fixed room tests that had, again, one off problem.

I tried first an arraylist that had a very simple removal method. It performed poorly, so I did some adjustments, which helped a bit.

After that tried optimising my den by starting with a integer content and changing the content into string only when printin.
